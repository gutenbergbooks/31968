<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Of the history of <span class="smcap">K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa</span>, to whom by general assent
the <span class="smcap">Kum&aacute;ra Sambhava</span>, or <span class="smcap">Birth of the War-God</span>,
is attributed, we know but little with any certainty; we can only gather
from a memorial-verse which enumerates their names, that he was one of the
'Nine Precious Stones' that shone at the Court of <span class="smcap">Vikram&aacute;ditya</span>,
King of <span class="smcap">Oujein</span>, in the half century immediately preceding the
Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
As the examination of arguments for and against the correctness of
this date is not likely to interest general readers, I must request
them to rest satisfied with the belief that about the time when <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>
and <span class="smcap">Horace</span> were shedding an undying lustre upon the reign of <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>,
our poet <span class="smcap">K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa</span> lived, loved, and sang, giving and
taking honour, at the polished court of the no less munificent patron
of Sanskrit literature, at the period of its highest perfection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg viii]</span>Little as we know of Indian poetry, here and there an
English reader may be found, who is not entirely unacquainted with the
name or works of the author of the beautiful dramas of <span
class="smcap">Sakontal&aacute;</span> and <span class="smcap">The Hero and the Nymph</span>, the former
of which has long enjoyed an European celebrity in the translation of
<span class="smcap">Sir William Jones</span>, and the latter is one of the most charming of
<span class="smcap">Professor Wilson's</span> specimens of the Hind&uacute;
Theatre; here and there even in England may be found a lover of the
graceful, tender, picturesque, and fanciful, who knows something, and
would gladly know more, of the sweet poet of the <span class="smcap">Cloud Messenger</span>, and
<span class="smcap">The Seasons</span>; whilst in Germany he has been deeply studied in the
original, and enthusiastically admired in translation,&mdash;not the
Orientalist merely, but the poet, the critic, the natural philosopher,&mdash;a
<span class="smcap">Goethe</span>, a <span class="smcap">Schlegel</span>, a <span class="smcap">Humboldt</span>,
having agreed, on account of his tenderness of feeling and his rich creative imagination,
to set <span class="smcap">K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa</span> very high among the glorious
company of the Sons of Song.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>That the poem which is now for the first time offered <span class='pagenum'>[Pg ix]</span>
to the general reader, in an English dress, will not diminish this reputation
is the translator's earnest hope, yet my admiration of the grace and
beauty that pervade so much of the work must not allow me to deny that
occasionally, even in the noble Sanskrit, if we judge him by an
European standard, <span class="smcap">K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa</span> is bald and prosaic. Nor is
this a defence of the translator at the expense of the poet. Fully am
I conscious how far I am from being able adequately to reproduce the
fanciful creation of the sweet singer of <span class="smcap">Oujein</span>; that numerous
beauties of thought and expression I may have passed by, mistaken,
marred; that in many of the more elaborate descriptions my own
versification is 'harsh as the jarring of a tuneless
chord' compared with the melody of <span class="smcap">K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa's</span>
rhythm, to rival whose sweetness and purity of language,
so admirably adapted to the soft repose and celestial
rosy hue of his pictures, would have tried all the fertility
of resource, the artistic skill, and the exquisite ear of
the author of <span class="smcap">Lalla Rookh</span> himself. I do not think
this poem deserves, and I am sure it will not obtain,
that admiration which the author's masterpieces already
made known at once commanded; at all events, if the
work itself is not inferior, it has not enjoyed the good
fortune of having a <span class="smcap">Jones</span> or a <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> for translator.</p>

<p>It may be as well to inform the reader, before he wonder at the
misnomer, that the <span class="smcap">Birth of the War-God</span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg x]</span> was either left unfinished by its author, or time has robbed us
of the conclusion; the latter is the more probable supposition,
tradition informing us that the poem originally consisted of
twenty-two cantos, of which only seven now
remain.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>I have derived great assistance in the work of translation
from the Calcutta printed edition of the poem in
the Library of the East-India House; but although the
Sanskrit commentaries accompanying the text are sometimes
of the greatest use in unravelling the author's
meaning, they can scarcely claim infallibility; and, not
unfrequently, are so matter-of-fact and prosaic, that I
have not scrupled to think, or rather to feel, for myself.
It is, however, <span class="smcap">Professor Stenzler's</span>
edition,<a name="FNanchor_B_4" id="FNanchor_B_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
published under the auspices of the Oriental Translation Fund (a
society that has liberally encouraged my own undertaking),
that I have chiefly used. Valuable as this work
is (and I will not disown my great obligations to it), it
is much to be regretted that the extracts from the native
commentators are so scanty, and the annotations so few
and brief.</p>

<p>And now one word as to the manner in which I have
endeavoured to perform my task. Though there is much,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg xi]</span>
I think, that might be struck out, to the advantage of
the poem, this I have in no instance ventured to do,
my aim having been to give the English reader as faithful
a cast of the original as my own power and the
nature of things would permit, and, without attempting
to give word for word or line for line, to produce upon
the imagination impressions similar to those which one
who studies the work in Sanskrit would experience.</p>

<p>I will not seek to anticipate the critics, nor to deprecate
their animadversions, by pointing out the beauties of the
poet, or particularising the defects of him and his translator.
That the former will be appreciated, and the
latter kindly dealt with, late experience makes me confident;
so that now, in the words of the Manager in the
Prelude to the <span class="smcap">Hero and the Nymph</span>,
"I have only to request the audience that they will listen to this
work of <span class="smcap">K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa</span> with attention and kindness, in
consideration of its subject and respect for the Author."</p>

<h2>PRELIMINARY NOTE.</h2>

<h4>PRONUNCIATION.</h4>


<p>As a general rule, the Sanskrit vowels are to be sounded
like those of the Italian alphabet, except the short or unaccented
<i>a</i>, which has the sound of that letter in the word
<i>America</i>: "<i>pandit</i>," a learned man, being pronounced <i>pundit</i>.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Pronunciations">
<tr>
  <td><i>&aacute;</i>, long or accented</td>
  <td>like <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>e</i></td>
  <td>like <i>e</i> in <i>they</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>i</i>, short or unaccented,</td>
  <td>like <i>i</i> in <i>pick</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>&iacute;</i>, long or accented</td>
  <td>like <i>i</i> in <i>pique</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>o</i></td>
  <td>like <i>o</i> in <i>go</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>u</i>, short or unaccented,</td>
  <td>like <i>u</i> in <i>full</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>&uacute;</i>, long or accented</td>
  <td>like <i>u</i> in <i>rule</i>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The diphthongs <i>ai</i> and <i>au</i> are pronounced severally like <i>i</i> in
<i>rise</i> and <i>ou</i> in <i>our</i>.</p>

<p>The consonants are sounded as in English. In the aspirates,
however, the sound of <i>h</i> is kept distinct; <i>dh</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>ph</i>, <i>bh</i>, &amp;c.,
being pronounced as in <i>red-hot</i>, <i>pent-house</i>, <i>up-hill</i>, <i>abhor</i>, &amp;c.
<i>G</i> is always hard, whatever vowel follows.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Him&aacute;laya</span> the accent is on the <i>second</i> syllable.</p>

<span class="i1">But, ah! how troubled was her mother's brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the sad tidings of the mourner's vow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She threw her arms around her own dear maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissed, fondly kissed her, sighed, and wept, and prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Are there no Gods, my child, to love thee here?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That prayer was weaker than her daughter's will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can recall the torrent's headlong force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the bold spirit in its destined course?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She sent a maiden to her sire, and prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He for her sake would grant some bosky shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she might dwell in solitude, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give all her soul to penance and to prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gracious love the great <span class="smcap">Him&aacute;laya</span> smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did the bidding of his darling child.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Rough to her gentle limbs, and gloomy dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pressing too tightly, till her swelling breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke into freedom through the unwonted vest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her matted hair was full as lovely now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when 'twas braided o'er her polished brow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The maid put off, but only for awhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her passioned glances and her witching smile.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In hermit's mantle was she clad; her look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixt in deep thought upon the Holy Book.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pure that grove: all war was made to cease,<br /></span>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>


<h4><i>CANTO FIRST.</i></h4>

<p>The Hind&uacute; Deity of War, the leader of the celestial armies, is
known by the names K&aacute;rtikeya and Skanda. He is represented with
six faces and corresponding arms, and is mounted upon a peacock.</p>

<p><a name="Himalaya" id="Himalaya"></a><a href="#HIManchor_A_1"><i>Him&aacute;laya.</i></a>]
Mansion of Snow; from <i>hima</i>, snow, and <i>&aacute;laya</i>, mansion. The
accent is on the <i>second</i> syllable.</p>

<p><a name="Prithu" id="Prithu"></a><a href="#PRIanchor_A_1"><i>Prithu.</i></a>]
It is said that in the reign of this fabulous monarch, gods, saints,
demons, and other supernatural beings, drained or <i>milked</i> from the
earth various treasures, appointing severally one of their own class
as the recipient, or <i>Calf</i>, to use the word of the legend.
Him&aacute;laya was thus highly favoured by the sacred Mount Meru, and
the other hills. The story is found in the sixth chapter of the
<i>Harivansa</i>, which forms a supplement to the <i>Mahabh&aacute;rat</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Pearls" id="Pearls"></a><a href="#PEARLanchor_A_1"><i>Still the fair pearls</i>, &amp;c.</a>]
It was the belief of the Hind&uacute;s that elephants wore these
precious jewels in their heads.</p>

<p><a name="Mins" id="Mins"></a><a href="#MINanchor_A_1"><i>Till heavenly minstrels</i>, &amp;c.</a>]
A class of demi-gods, the songsters of the Hind&uacute; Paradise, or
Indra's heaven.</p>

<p><a name="Herbs" id="Herbs"></a><a href="#HERBanchor_A_1"><i>There magic herbs</i>, &amp;c.</a>]
Frequent allusion is made by K&aacute;lid&aacute;s and other Sanskrit
poets to a phosphoric light emitted by plants at night.</p>

<p><a name="kine" id="kine"></a><a href="#kine_a"><i>E'en the wild kine</i>, &amp;c.</a>]
The <i>Chouri</i>, or long brush, used to whisk off insects and flies, was
with the Hind&uacute;s what the sceptre is with us. It was usually
made of the tail-hairs of the <i>Yak</i>, or <i>Bos Grunniens</i>. Thus the poet
represents these animals as doing honour to the Monarch of Mountains
with these emblems of sovereignty.</p>

<a name="seven" id="seven"></a><a href="#seven_a"><i>That the bright Seven.</i></a>]
The Hind&uacute;s call the constellation <i>Ursa Major</i> the seven
Rishis, or Saints. They will appear as actors in the course of the
poem.</p>

<p><a name="indra" id="indra"></a><a href="#indra_a"><i>And once when Indra's might.</i></a>]
We learn from the <i>R&aacute;m&aacute;yana</i> that the mountains were
originally furnished with wings, and that they flew through the air
with the speed of the wind. For fear lest they should suddenly fall in
their flight, Indra, King of the Gods, struck off their pinions with
his thunderbolt; but Main&aacute;ka was preserved from a similar fate
by the friendship of Ocean, to whom he fled for refuge.</p>

<p><a name="born" id="born"></a><a href="#born_a"><i>Born once again</i>, &amp;c.</a>]
The reader will remember the Hind&uacute; belief in the Transmigration
of Souls. The story alluded to by the poet is this:&mdash;"<i>Daksha</i>
was the son of <i>Brahm&aacute;</i> and father of <i>Sat&iacute;</i>, whom, at
the recommendation of the <i>Rishis</i>, or Sages, he espoused to
<i>&#346;iva</i>, but he was never wholly reconciled to the uncouth figure
and practices of his son-in-law. Having undertaken to celebrate a
solemn sacrifice, he invited all the Gods except <i>&#346;iva</i>, which so
incensed <i>Sat&iacute;</i>, that she threw herself into the sacrificial
fire."&mdash;(Wilson, Specimens of Hind&uacute; Theatre, Vol. II. p.
263.) The name of <i>Sat&iacute;</i>, meaning good, true, chaste woman, is
the modern <i>Suttee</i>, as it is corruptly written.</p>

<p><a name="turq" id="turq"></a><a href="#turq_a"><i>As the blue offspring of the Turquois Hills.</i></a>]
These hills are placed in Ceylon. The precious stone grows, it is said, at
the sound of thunder in the rainy season.</p>

<p><a name="stern" id="stern"></a><a href="#stern_a"><i>At her stern penance.</i></a>]
This is described in the fifth canto. The meaning of the name Um&aacute;
is "Oh, do not."</p>

<p><a name="ganga" id="ganga"></a><a href="#ganga_a"><i>The Gods' bright river.</i></a>]
The celestial Ganges, which falls from heaven upon Him&aacute;laya's head,
and continues its course on earth.</p>

<p><a name="kama" id="kama"></a><a href="#kama_a"><i>Young K&aacute;ma's arrow.</i></a>]
K&aacute;ma, the Hind&uacute; Cupid, is armed with a bow, the arrows of which are made of flowers.</p>

Nothing, we are told, can exceed the beauty of this tree when in full

<span class="smcap">Moore</span>&mdash;<i>Loves of the Angels.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Moore is frequently the best interpreter, unconsciously, of an Indian
poet's thought. It is worth remarking, that the Sanskrit word
<i>mukt&aacute;</i>, pearl (literally <i>freed</i>), signifies also the <i>spirit</i>
released from mundane existence, and re-integrated with its divine
original.</p>

<p><a name="koil" id="koil"></a><a href="#koil_a"><i>The sweetest note that e'er the K&ouml;il poured.</i></a>]
The <i>Kokila</i>, or <i>K&ouml;il</i>, the black or Indian cuckoo, is the
bulbul or nightingale of Hind&uacute;stan. It is also the herald of
spring, like its European namesake, and the female bird is the
especial messenger of Love.</p>

<h4><i>CANTO SECOND.</i></h4>

<p><a name="tarak" id="tarak"></a><a href="#tarak_a"><i>While impious T&aacute;rak.</i></a>]
A demon who, by a long course of austerities, had acquired power even

Southey's "Curse of Keh&aacute;ma."</p>

<p><a name="mystic" id="mystic"></a><a href="#mystic_a"><i>The mystic Three.</i></a>]
"The triad of qualities," a philosophical term familiar to all the
systems of Hind&uacute; speculation. They are thus explained in the
<i>Tattwa Sam&aacute;sa</i>, a text-book of the S&aacute;nkhya
school:&mdash;"Now it is asked, What is the 'triad of qualities'? It
is replied, The triad of qualities consists of 'Goodness,' 'Foulness,'
and 'Darkness.' By the 'triad of qualities' is meant the 'three
qualities.' Goodness is endlessly diversified, accordingly as it is
exemplified in calmness, lightness, complacency, attainment of wishes,
kindliness, contentment, patience, joy, and the like; summarily, it
consists of happiness. 'Foulness' is endlessly diversified,
accordingly as it is exemplified in grief, distress, separation,
excitement, anxiety, fault-finding, and the like; summarily, it
consists of pain. 'Darkness' is endlessly diversified, accordingly as
it is exemplified in envelopment, ignorance, disgust, abjectness,
heaviness, sloth, drowsiness, intoxication, and the like; summarily,
it consists of delusion."</p>

"Having divided his own substance, the mighty power became half male,
half female, or <i>nature active and passive</i>."&mdash;<i>Manu</i>, Ch. I.</p>

<p>So also in the old Orphic hymn it is said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

expresses the Three in One.</p>

<p><a name="nature" id="nature"></a><a href="#nature_a"><i>They hail thee, Nature.</i></a>]
The object of Nature's activity, according to the S&aacute;nkhya system,
is "the final liberation of individual soul." "The incompetency of nature,
an irrational principle, to institute a course of action for a definite
purpose, and the unfitness of rational soul to regulate the acts of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
agent whose character it imperfectly apprehends, constitute a
principal argument with the theistical S&aacute;nkhyas for the
necessity of a Providence, to whom the ends of existence are known,
and by whom Nature is guided.... The atheistical S&aacute;nkhyas, on
the other hand, contend that there is no occasion for a guiding
Providence, but that the activity of nature, for the purpose of
accomplishing soul's object, is an intuitive necessity, as illustrated
in the following passage:&mdash;As it is a function of milk, an
unintelligent (substance), to nourish the calf, so it is the office of
the chief principle (nature) to liberate the soul."&mdash;Prof.

<p><a name="angers" id="angers"></a><a href="#angers_a"><i>Who angers thee, &amp;c.</i></a>]
To understand properly this speech of K&aacute;ma, it is necessary to
be acquainted with some of the Hind&uacute; notions regarding a future
state. "The highest kind of happiness is absorption into the divine
essence, or the return of that portion of spirit which is combined
with the attributes of humanity to its original source. This
happiness, according to the philosopher, is to be obtained only by the
most perfect abstraction from the world and freedom from passion, even
while in a state of terrestrial existence.... Besides this ultimate
felicity, the Hind&uacute;s have several minor degrees of happiness,
amongst which is the enjoyment of Indra's Swarga, or, in fact, of a
Muhammadan Paradise. The degree and duration of the pleasures of this
paradise are proportioned to the merits of those admitted to it; and
they who have enjoyed this lofty region of Swarga, but whose virtue is
exhausted, revisit the habitation of mortals."&mdash;Prof. Wilson's
<i>Megha D&uacute;ta</i>. Compare also "The Lord's Song."&mdash;<i>Specimens
of Old Indian Poetry</i>, pp. 67, 68.</p>

<p>Indra, therefore, may be supposed to feel jealous whenever a human
being aspires to something higher than that heaven of which he is the
Lord.</p>

<p>The "chain of birth" alluded to is of course the metempsychosis, or
transmigration of souls, a belief which is not to be looked upon (says
Prof. Wilson in the preface to his edition of the <i>S&aacute;nkhya
K&aacute;rik&aacute;</i>) as a mere popular superstition. It is the main
principle of all Hind&uacute; metaphysics; it is the foundation of all
Hind&uacute; philosophy. The great object of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
their philosophical research in every system, Brahminical or Buddhist,
is the discovery of the means of putting a stop to further
transmigration; the discontinuance of corporeal being; the liberation
of soul from body.</p>

ornament or a sectarial distinction; the poet intends the word to
convey both ideas at once here. In this passage is another comparison
of the mango-spray: it is called the <i>lip</i> of Love; its <i>rouge</i> is the
blush of morning, and its darker beautifying powder the clustering
bees. From the universal custom of dying the lips,

of which is fingered with the mental repetition of one of S'iva's
108 appellations.</p>

size, so that he measured the earth with one pace, and the heavens
with another.</p>
